This package was created to split of the Skins from the mplayer package.
These skins are arch:all anyway, so we save a bit archive space.

This makes it possible to distribute more mplayer skins. If a new skin
is to be added to this package, just drop the new *.tar.bz file into 
the orig.tar.gz and increase the version number. Please not that the
skin needs a proper copyright statement!
