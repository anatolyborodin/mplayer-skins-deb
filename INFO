 Description: Skins for the Mplayer package
  Mplayer plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many native and
  win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The other
  big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It
  works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
  this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
  Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
  so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
  .
  This package contains only some skins for mplayer
